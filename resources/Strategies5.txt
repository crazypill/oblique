Towards the insignificant
Be extravagant
Disciplined self-indulgence

Do we need holes?
Make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame
Short circuit (example; a man eating peas with the idea that they will improve his virility shovels them straight into his lap)

You are an engineer
In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly

Humanise something free of error
Is there something missing?
Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them
Make a sudden, destructive unpredictable action; incorporate

Overtly resist change
Remember those quiet evenings
Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics
Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

Just carry on

Take a break
The inconsistency principle
Tidy up
Turn it upside down
Use 'unqualified' people
