This is the source code for Oblique for iOS 1.0.  Now updated to iOS 11.

It was originally written for iOS 1.0 and was one of the very first ever iPhone Apps.  It existed long before the AppStore and was eventually ported to the AppStore when it finally opened.  Eventually the lovely folks that run Brian Eno's legal asked me to remove this app even though it was carefully built to not infringe on Brian Eno's copyrights.  We made no money or advertising from building this app so our opinion was that it was fair use.

Either way, it's gone now but if you miss the app and want it back, here it is.  Just build it and enjoy.  It also supports swipe gesture in case you don't want to watch the cards flip back and forth to go through them.

Enjoy.
